# slider
This is a simple web slider. It is customizable, but you have to edit files manually.

Slides are not working out of the box, you have to edit them.

(PHP installer is coming soon)

There are two versions:

- WebKit only (webkit.html) - This version works only in WebKit browsers like Chrome, Safari (untested) etc.
- Normal (normal.html) - This version works in all major browsers like Firefox.

It is highly recommended to use the normal version.
